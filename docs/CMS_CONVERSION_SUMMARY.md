**Simple forms like this for every section!**

## What Stays Hardcoded (Design):

These WON'T be editable (for brand consistency):
- ❌ Colors, fonts, spacing
- ❌ Layouts, grid structures
- ❌ Animations, hover effects
- ❌ Icons (can change which ones to show)

**Why?** Keeps design professional and prevents accidental breaking.
